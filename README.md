# Eat-da-burger
I created a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

### Overview

I created a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.
### Deployment 
This assignment was deployed on Heroku using the MySQL Heroku deployment process.

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Folder organization and structure follows MVC framework.
